A project in which a set of socio-economic factors of high-school students in Portugal are investigated with their relation to the student's performance, potentially giving some advice to future parents who would like their children to perform well academically. Done as a part of the 'Introduction to Machine Learning & Data Mining' MSc course under DTU, with classmate Mario Cesar Rodriguez.

Tl;dr: Want your child to perform well in school? Make sure both you and your spouse are educated. Ensure that your child drinks the least amount of alcohol as infrequently as possible (especially in the workdays). Situate yourself in an urban setting (if close to school), and provide your child with access to internet.
